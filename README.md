# SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `sqlalchemy-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Add your Jupyter notebook and `app.py` to this folder. These will be the main scripts to run for analysis.

4. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.

## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

* Use the provided [starter notebook](climate_starter.ipynb) and [hawaii.sqlite](Resources/hawaii.sqlite) files to complete your climate analysis and data exploration.

* Use SQLAlchemy `create_engine` to connect to your sqlite database.

* Use SQLAlchemy `automap_base()` to reflect your tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called `Station` and `Measurement`.

### Precipitation Analysis

* Design a query to retrieve the `date` and `prcp` values from the last 12 months of precipitation data (from the most recent date in the database).
  * There are more than one `prcp` value for each date. Calculate the average of these values so you have a single `prcp` value per date.

* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

* Sort the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Plot the results using the DataFrame `plot` method. Your plot may look different from the one below.

* Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

### Station Analysis

* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.

* Design a query that lists all stations with their corresponding observation count in descending order.

  * Which station is the most active (i.e., has the greatest number of observations)?

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS) for the most active station.

  * Plot the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.

## Step 2 - Climate App

Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

* Use Flask to create your routes.

### Routes

* `/`

  * Home page.

  * List all routes that are available.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Using the query from part 1 (most recent 12 months of precipitation data), convert the query results to a dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.
  * Return the JSON representation of your dictionary (note the specific format of your dictionary as required from above).

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
  * Query the dates and temperature observations of the **most active station** for the latest year of data.
  
  * Return a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for that year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Create a query that returns the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.
    * Hint: You will need to use a function such as `func.min`, `func.max`, `func.avg`, and `func.count` in your queries.

  * When given the start date only, calculate min, max, and avg for all dates greater than and equal to the start date.

  * When given the start and the end date, calculate the min, avg, and max for dates between the start and end date inclusive.
  
  * Return a JSONified dictionary of min, max, and avg temperatures.

## Bonus: Other Recommended Analyses

* The following are optional challenge queries. These are highly recommended to attempt, but not required for the homework.

### Temperature Analysis I

* Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?

* You may either use SQLAlchemy or pandas's `read_csv()` to perform this portion.

* Identify the average temperature in June at all stations across all available years in the dataset. Do the same for December temperature.

* Use the t-test to determine whether the difference in the means, if any, is statistically significant. Will you use a paired t-test, or an unpaired t-test? Why?

### Temperature Analysis II

* The starter notebook contains a function called `calc_temps` that will accept a start date and end date in the format `%Y-%m-%d`. The function will return the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for that range of dates.

* Use the `calc_temps` function to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for a 3-10 day trip using the matching dates from the most recent year in the databse (i.e., use "2018-01-01" if your trip start date was "2021-01-01").

* Plot the min, avg, and max temperature from your previous query as a bar chart.

  * Use the average temperature as the bar height.

  * Use the peak-to-peak (TMAX-TMIN) value as the y error bar (YERR).

### Daily Temperature Average

* Calculate the daily normals across all weather stations for all previous years with matching month and day. Normals are the averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures.
  * You are provided with a function called `daily_normals` that will return the daily normals for a specific month and day in **tuple format**. This date string will be in the format `%m-%d`. Be sure to use all historic TOBS that match that date string.

* Use the `daily_normals` function to calculate the normals for each date string and append the resulting tuples to a list.

* Load the list of daily normals into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index equal to the date.

* Use Pandas to plot an area plot (`stacked=False`) for the daily normals.
